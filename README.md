Face Detection and Recognition Project
Overview
This project implements a face detection and recognition system using OpenCV and NumPy. It captures and processes face data to enable real-time facial recognition and generate voice responses. The system leverages the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for face recognition.

Features
Face Collection: Collects face data from a camera feed and stores it as NumPy arrays for training.
Face Recognition: Recognizes faces in real-time using KNN and matches them with the collected face data.
Voice Interaction: Provides a voice response using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) and pyttsx3 libraries to interact with recognized individuals.
Haar Cascade Classifier: Utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in the video feed.
